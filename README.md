## Description

  <span style="color:#F4F1BB">
  With this application, users are able to create, save and delete tasks. The user can leave the webpage, and after returning saved notes will still be present. My focus in creating this application was to challenge my understanding of routes. I decided to create two routes, one for notes, and the other for savedNotes, before fully understanding that this was both unncessary and made the developer experience more difficult. I simplified my code and deleted this unncessary file.
